# HartRAO-Data-Reduction
Pipeline for reducing data from the HartRAO Radio Observatory in South Africa, most of the code is rebranded from https://github.com/ska-sa/tutorials/tree/master/4_HartRAO_spectral_line.
The main differences are : This code is written to run from the terminal with minimal user input. <br/>
### Currently code does the following : 
-Calculates pointing correction for continuum sources. <br/>
-Calculates PSS for calibration sources (Only Virgo_A at the moment). <br/>
-Also does spectral line data reductions : Bandpass correction and pointing correction. <br/>
Data that this was tested on was obtained from : https://github.com/ska-sa/tutorials/tree/master/4_HartRAO_spectral_line/data
